# Vizdom

# Setup
We are using `npm` for running scripts and commands.  
  
We start by installing the necessary packages  
`npm run setup`  
This will create an environment called `vizdom` and install all the necessary packages in it.  

> pip3 packages need to be installed after activating vizdom, for now this has to be done manually. So activate vizdom, and then run the following.  

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# Starting Server
The dash server can be started using the following command.  
`npm start`
